## Description

Plugin to interface between CloudyPanel and Engine

## Setup

In your game folder, create a folder named 'Plugins' if it doesn't exist. Put CloudyPanelPlugin in your Plugins folder. Build and run your game. The plugin should show up in Menu > Edit > Plugins.

## Usage
Can now capture and output video, with no split screen. output.avi (and the ffmpeg log file out.txt) is probably generated in your Unreal Engine\Engine\Binaries\Win64 folder.
