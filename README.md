## Description

Plugin to interface between CloudyPanel and Engine

## Setup

In your game folder, create a folder named 'Plugins' if it doesn't exist. Put CloudyPanelPlugin in your Plugins folder. Build and run your game. The plugin should show up in Menu > Edit > Plugins.

## Usage
Has been updated to include very rough streaming (proof of concept). output.avi is probably generated in your Unreal Engine\Engine\Binaries\Win64 folder. Only contains 1 frame as of now.
